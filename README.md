# AI Engineer Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal **AI Engineering Learning Repository**!

This is a place where I document everything I learn on my path to becoming an AI engineer — from core machine learning theory to practical model building and deployment.  
All code, notes, experiments, and insights are written in English to make the knowledge accessible and shareable with the global tech community.

## Why this repository?

- To organize my knowledge in one place
- To practice real-world AI tools and frameworks (like PyTorch, Transformers, etc.)
- To build a public portfolio of projects and experiments
- To learn in public and help others doing the same

## What's included?

- Hands-on code examples with explanations
- Notes and summaries of key AI/ML concepts
- Model training experiments and results
- Mini-projects, prototypes, and utilities

This is not just a collection of files — it's a living notebook of my AI journey.  
Feel free to explore, learn something new, or reach out with ideas and suggestions!
