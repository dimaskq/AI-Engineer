# Problems on matrices NumPy
As we all know, practice is the best teacher, here are the problems I solved to understand NumPy


## Level 1 — Basics

### Task 1
Create a 3x3 matrix filled with random integers from 0 to 10.

### Task 2
Replace all values greater than 5 with 0.

### Task 3
Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).

### Task 4
Reshape the matrix from (3, 3) to (1, 9).

### Task 5
Normalize the values: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.

### Task 6
Given the array: `a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])`, reshape it to (2, 3).

### Task 7
From the array: `a = np.array([[1, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [4, 0, 0]])`, create a one-dimensional array containing only non-zero values in the same order.

### Task 8
Given the array: `a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])`, transform it into a 2D array with 3 identical rows.

### Task 9
Given the array: `a = np.array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11])`, replace all odd numbers with -1 without using loops.

### Task 10
Given the array:
```python
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]])
```
Replace all elements greater than 5 with 1, and all others with 0.

## Level 2 — Data Science Oriented

### Task 11
Given the array `[50, 55, 60, 65, 70]`, compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation.

### Task 12
Generate a dataset with shape (100, 5), where each column has a different mean.

### Task 13
Apply Z-normalization to each column of the dataset (subtract the mean and divide by the std).

### Task 14
Find all rows in a (100, 5) dataset where all values are greater than 0.

### Task 15
Compute the cosine similarity between two vectors of shape (100,).

### Task 16
Create an array of numbers from 1 to 100, select all numbers divisible by 7 and calculate their sum.

### Task 17
Create a 4x5 matrix with random integers from 0 to 9. Replace all even numbers with 0.
